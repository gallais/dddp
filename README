This contains the source code for the TyDe 2019 paper, "Deferring the details and deriving programs".

The paper pre-print (will shortly be) available on my personal website.

The Agda source code is in the src directory. The file Index.agda outlines the various modules in the development.

The paper directory contains the (ugly) LaTeX source code for the paper, and the talk directory contains the (ugly) LaTeX source code for the talk slides.
